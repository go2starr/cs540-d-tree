	java BuildAndTestDecisionTree <trainsetFilename> <testSetFilename>



Discussion:


	Both of the decision trees appear to have generalized the data quite well.  To begin, the Titanic
dataset produced a tree which, among other things, showed that woman and children had a much greater
change of survival than adult males did.  This matches closely with the passanger's sentiment on the Titanic
that women and children should be saved first.

	Similarly, the house data matches the sentiments of both republican and democrat party's, from a
non-data point of view.

	Beyond the higher level accuracy of the decision trees, both of the training sets produced trees
which very accurately, and succinctly, were able to predict future data.

	Because both training sets only had binary features, it is understandable that some mistakes were made.
But again, the trees very simply described the patterns within the datasets.
